- To run : `tsc fileName`
- to watch ie conti run: ` tsc --watch fileName`
- config file: `tsc --init`
- output is outDir in config file and we use dist
- input is rootDir in config file and we use src
- TYPES: number, boolean, string, any, array, tuple, union, array of tuples, enum
- ENUm: they have number assigned to each option (0-1-2-3 by default)
    follow some kind of numbers
- function: ` function fName(param1: paramType, param2:paramType): functionType {
    return param1 + param2;
}
    if no return use void
- interface defines the struct but we use types sometimes cause we cant use interface with primitaves or unions
    for prop to be optional, put ? after it.
    for prop to be read only not changeable, put `readonly` before it
- classes
    private: acces only class, cant colsole log
    protected: main class or child class only
    public any
- interface for class is used by adding `implements intervaceName`
- extend classes
    `extends parentClassName`
    we add super(param1, param2) for calling constructor of parent class in child
- GENERICS
    used to do generic things by giving type of a function dynamically
    example in file
    reusable components
